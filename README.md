# What's Poppin?

Common project to work in the [Swift Peer Lab](https://swiftpeerlab.github.io).

## App Concept

A mobile app to discover what is happening in your city in real-time.

Users upload a short duration video of their experience, other users can see a list of experiences in a map and decide if they want to join them.

These experiences expire in a short amount of time to keep the information relevant to what is happening.

Users can give feedback on the experience in order to help improving the quality of the information.

Users can tag their experience and search for relevant terms.
